# 🛟 Offline Emergency Kit — START HERE

This drive is a self-contained **offline survival library + AI**. Everything works with
**no internet**. This page explains what's here and how to open each part.

> 🆘 **In an emergency right now?** Open **[I need to…](I-NEED-TO.html)** — a task-first
> index that sends you straight to the right file for bleeding, CPR, water, calling for
> help, navigation and more.

> **How this kit is meant to be used:** the books, manuals and maps are the authority.
> The offline AI is a fast
> **assistant**: it helps you *find and digest* the library - search it, summarize it,
> cross-reference it. For anything safety-critical (medical doses, water treatment,
> first-aid steps), read the manual itself and follow it.

> **Windows vs macOS/Linux:** launchers are `.bat` files on Windows and `.sh` files on
> macOS/Linux (run them from a terminal). The content, PDFs, HTML guides, and phone apps
> are identical on every platform.

> **Three ways to read and use things on this drive:**
> - **PDFs and these guides (.html)** open in **Edge or any web browser** — no software.
> - **`.zim` archives** open in **Kiwix** (portable, no install) — see
>   `E:\Kiwix-Reader\`.
> - **Ask questions of the bundled docs** = **GPT4All LocalDocs** - see
>   `E:\AI-Offline\DocReader-GPT4All\`.

## Quick start by need

- **Keep a device charged off-grid:** read [Power and devices](POWER-AND-DEVICES.html)
  for battery sizing, solar/car charging and low-power reading setups.
- **I want to chat with an AI offline:** `AI-Offline\` → double-click `CHAT-3B-light.bat`
  (great for brainstorming and summaries; for anything safety-critical, follow the manuals).
- **I want the AI to answer from my manuals - recommended for medical & survival questions:**
  set up `DocReader-GPT4All` (see its guide); its **LocalDocs** feature answers from the
  bundled docs and *shows the sources it used*, so you can check them. Point it at
  `Manuals\ArmyFieldManuals` and `Medical\Manuals-PDF`, ask away.
- **I need to fix something (car/appliance/plumbing/electrical):** open Kiwix →
  `Manuals\Repair-iFixit` and `Manuals\DIY-Appropedia`.
- **Medical / first aid:** open Kiwix → `Medical\WikiMed`; or read the PDFs in
  `Medical\Manuals-PDF`; Army first aid in `Manuals\ArmyFieldManuals`.
- **Survival / water / food:** Kiwix → `Manuals\Survival-Water-Food`; plus the Army
  survival PDFs.
- **Communicate by radio:** read `Manuals\Radio-Communications\RADIO-GUIDE.html`.
- **Learn / study (courses + video):** open `Education\` in Kiwix (if you added Khan Academy
  with `-Education` / `--education`; see `Education\READ-ME-FIRST.html`).
- **Look something up:** Wikipedia (via Kiwix) and the maps (`OsmAnd\HOW-TO-VIEW-MAPS.html`
  — works on a PC with no phone).

## Dependencies — kept to a minimum

| Content | Needs | Bundled here? |
|---|---|---|
| PDFs & `.html` guides | A web browser (Edge is on Windows) | n/a — already on Windows |
| `.zim` archives | **Kiwix** (portable, no install) | ✅ `E:\Kiwix-Reader\app` |
| Offline AI chat | Nothing extra (self-contained engine) | ✅ `E:\AI-Offline\engine` |
| AI doc-Q&A | **GPT4All** (one-time install; self-contained, CPU) | ✅ installer in `DocReader-GPT4All` |
| Maps on a computer | Bundled desktop viewer + portable Java (no phone needed) | ✅ `OsmAnd\MapViewer-Desktop` |
| Maps on Android | Bundled **OsmAnd~ APK** (sideload offline) | ✅ `OsmAnd\PhoneApp-Android` |
| Maps on iPhone/iPad | OsmAnd from the App Store | app store (get while online) |

Everything that needs a one-time online step (GPT4All's first run, phone apps) should be
set up **now, while you still have internet**, so the kit is fully usable offline later.

## ⚠️ Reminders

- Offline AIs and old manuals **can be wrong**. Use the AI to find and summarize; for
  anything safety-critical, read the manual itself and follow it.
- Keep the drive **backed up** (a second copy on another drive/USB is wise), and run
  **CHECK-DRIVE** (`CHECK-DRIVE.bat` on Windows, `CHECK-DRIVE.command` on macOS) every few
  months to find damaged files.
- **Practice** using each tool now so it's familiar in an actual emergency.
