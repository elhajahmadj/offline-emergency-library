**A complete, offline, no-internet "survival knowledge" kit you can download with a single
command.** Built for emergencies, grid-down scenarios, remote areas, or anyone who wants a
self-contained offline reference + AI on a drive.

One command asks you **only one thing — where to save the files — then downloads
everything** and writes all the documentation (Markdown **and** HTML). After that, it all
works with **no internet**.

## Start here

You need a computer with internet and a drive with **128 GB or more free** (an external SSD
is best). The download is about 85 GB and can take several hours.

**Windows**
1. [Download this project as a ZIP](https://github.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),
   right-click it and choose **Extract All**.
2. In the extracted folder, double-click **`install.bat`**. If Windows says "Windows
   protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
3. Type where to save the files, for example `E:\`, and press Enter.

**Mac**
1. [Download this project as a ZIP](https://github.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
   If the Mac does not open it for you, double-click it in Downloads.
2. In the folder, double-click **`install.command`**. The first time, the Mac says
   *"install.command" Not Opened*: click **Done**, open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**,
   click **Open Anyway** (twice), and type your password.
3. Type where to save the files, for example `/Volumes/MyDrive`, and press Return.

**Linux**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Paste this line and press Enter:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/main/get-offline-library.sh | bash
   ```
3. Type where to save the files, for example `/media/you/MyDrive`, and press Enter.

That is the only question. Leave the window open until it says **Finished**, then open
**`START-HERE.html`** in the `OfflineLibrary` folder it made there. If the download stops, run it again the same
way: it carries on where it left off.

Smaller drive, another country's maps, or extra content? See
[Advanced: options and flags](#advanced-options-and-flags).

## 📦 Storage requirements — what kind of drive do I need?

The full library is **~85 GB**. Always leave headroom (for the AI's temp files, GPT4All
install, and future updates), so plan for more than 60 GB.

Before the first download, the installer prints a size estimate for the options you chose
(maps for your region and every opt-in included) next to the free space, and warns if it
will not fit.

| Drive | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Minimum** | **128 GB** drive (full library + working room) |
| **Comfortable** | **256 GB** drive (room to add your own files, Survivor Library, etc.) |
| **USB flash drive** | Works for **storage + reading** PDFs/Wikipedia/maps. Use **USB 3.0+ / 128 GB+**. Cheap flash drives are slow — fine for reading, slow for AI. |
| **External SSD** ⭐ | **Best choice.** Running the AI models from an SSD is far faster than from a flash drive or spinning disk. A 256 GB+ USB-C SSD is ideal. |
| **Internal HDD/SSD** | Perfect if you're keeping it on a PC. |

> **Tip:** If you only want the reference material (no AI), you can skip the big pieces
> with `-SkipModels` and still get Wikipedia, maps, and all manuals in ~30 GB. If you also
> skip Wikipedia and maps (`-SkipWikipedia -SkipMaps`), the AI + manuals fit in ~20 GB. (Wikipedia is now ~49 GB.)
>
> **Adding Khan Academy?** It's **opt-in** and **~168 GB with videos** — budget for a
> **256 GB+** (ideally 512 GB) drive if you include `-Education`.

---

## 💻 Hardware requirements — what machine do I need to USE it?

**Planning for an outage?** Read [Power and devices](docs/POWER-AND-DEVICES.md)
([offline HTML](docs/POWER-AND-DEVICES.html)) for Wh budgets, charging options
and lower-power ways to read the library.

**To download:** any 64-bit **Windows, macOS, or Linux** computer with internet.
- Windows: uses `curl` + PowerShell (both built in).
- macOS/Linux: uses `curl` + `tar` (built in); `unzip` enables the desktop map viewer.
- **Optional but recommended: install [`aria2`](https://aria2.github.io/).** If `aria2c`
  is on your PATH, the installer uses it automatically for **much faster** multi-connection
  downloads (big win on the large files). Falls back to `curl` if it's absent or you pass
  `-NoAria`/`--no-aria`.

Downloading ~85 GB can take several hours.

**To use it afterward (offline):**

| Task | Needs |
|---|---|
| Read PDFs, HTML guides, Wikipedia, maps | **Any computer** with a web browser. Even an old/weak PC. |
| Read `.zim` archives | **Kiwix** — bundled portable on Windows & Linux; on macOS install Kiwix (App Store/kiwix.org). |
| **Offline AI — small model (3B)** | Any 64-bit PC, **~4 GB RAM**. Works on CPU; no graphics card needed. |
| **Offline AI — big model (8B)** | **~8 GB RAM** recommended. CPU only. |
| **Offline AI — GPU model (Qwen 7B)** | A graphics card with **~6 GB VRAM** (NVIDIA/AMD/Intel) for a big speed boost. Optional. |
| **Offline translator** *(opt-in)* | 64-bit PC, **~6 GB RAM** (about 4.8 GB in use while it runs). CPU only. |
| **GPT4All doc-Q&A** | 64-bit PC, ~8 GB RAM recommended. CPU only. Self-contained (no Python/CUDA). |
| **Maps on a computer** | **No phone needed.** Offline: browser maps (US, `-BrowserMaps`). The bundled desktop viewer (OsmAndMapCreator + portable Java) draws online tiles on Windows and macOS, so it is blank with no internet ([#15](https://github.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/issues/15)); use an Android phone for non-US offline maps. First use of the desktop viewer unzips maps (~30 GB). |
| **Maps on a phone** | Android: bundled **OsmAnd~ APK** (sideload offline). iPhone/iPad: install **OsmAnd** from the App Store while online. |

**Key points:**
- **No GPU is required** for the AI — it runs on an ordinary CPU (just slower). A 6 GB GPU
  is a bonus.
- The AI engine ships **x64, ARM64, and Vulkan-GPU** builds, so it runs on Intel/AMD and
  ARM Windows machines.
- The whole kit is **portable** — copy the `OfflineLibrary` folder to any PC and use it.

## 🚀 Other ways to install

### A) Double-click `install.bat` (Windows) or `install.command` (Mac)
The steps are in [Start here](#start-here) at the top of this page.

### B) In Claude Code (one prompt)
Install this repo's skill, then say:
```
/offline-emergency-library
```
It will ask **only**: *"Where would you like to save these files?"* — then download
everything.

### C) Windows — PowerShell one-liner (no Claude needed)
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/main/Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 | iex
```
It will prompt you for the save location, then download everything.

### D) macOS / Linux — one-liner
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/main/get-offline-library.sh | bash
```
It will prompt you for the save location, then download everything.
(Requires `curl` and `tar`; `unzip` enables the desktop map viewer. All are standard.)

### E) Clone and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library.git
cd offline-emergency-library
# Windows:
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "E:\"
# macOS / Linux:
./get-offline-library.sh -d /path/to/drive
```

**All methods are resumable** — if the download is interrupted, run the same command again
and it continues where it left off.

### Platform support
| | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installer | `Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1` / `install.bat` | `get-offline-library.sh` / `install.command` | `get-offline-library.sh` |
| Offline AI chat | ✅ (x64/ARM + Vulkan GPU) | ✅ (Metal GPU) | ✅ (x64/ARM + Vulkan GPU) |
| GPT4All doc-Q&A | ✅ `.exe` | ✅ `.dmg` | ✅ `.run` |
| Kiwix desktop | ✅ bundled portable | App Store / kiwix.org | ✅ bundled AppImage (x64) |
| Maps on PC | ⚠️ viewer needs internet; offline: browser maps (US) | ⚠️ viewer needs internet; offline: browser maps (US) | viewer bundled (offline untested); browser maps (US) |
| All content (Wikipedia, ZIM, PDF, maps, APKs) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Quick start with a smaller download

**Lite still includes all US maps by default (about 17 GB of maps alone).**
Before prompting for a destination or starting downloads, the installers show
the selected map region and flags to choose a smaller area or skip maps.

Use `-Lite` (PowerShell) or `--lite` (Bash) to get the **3B AI model**, AI engines,
medical and survival archives, PDF manuals, Kiwix reader, phone apps and regional
maps. It skips full Wikipedia, the 8B/7B models, GPT4All, iFixit and Appropedia.
Only the 3B chat and web-UI launchers are written on a fresh lite install.

Because lite omits GPT4All, a lite drive has **no source-citing AI** — only the plain 3B
chat. Treat its answers as leads and verify anything safety-critical against the manuals; to
add the citing **LocalDocs** workflow, re-run without the lite flag (details in
`HOW-TO-RUN-OFFLINE-AI`).

```powershell
.\Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "E:\" -Lite -Region US_delaware
```
```bash
./get-offline-library.sh -d /path/to/drive --lite --region US_delaware
```

**This is not a fixed 2-3 GB bundle.** The model, references and bundled tools
already take several GB, and maps vary by region. Maps still default to **US**
(about 17 GB of maps alone); choose a small sub-region as above, or add
`-SkipMaps` / `--skip-maps` to omit maps, their viewer and the OsmAnd app.
Education and Kolibri remain opt-in and can be combined with lite.

To expand later, re-run into the **same destination without the lite flag**.
Existing downloads are resumed/reused; lite does not remove previously downloaded
files or launchers. With no lite flag, the default full-library behavior is unchanged.

## 🔐 Trust & verification

This project **hosts nothing** — it downloads from the official upstream sources below and
runs 100% offline afterward:

| What | From |
|---|---|
| AI models (GGUF) | huggingface.co (bartowski) |
| AI engine (llama.cpp) | github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp |
| GPT4All | github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all |
| Kiwix reader + ZIM archives | download.kiwix.org |
| Wikipedia | download.kiwix.org |
| Maps + desktop viewer | download.osmand.net |
| Browser maps (optional) | github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad-maps (maps, style), unpkg.com (MapLibre GL JS, pmtiles.js), github.com/caddyserver/caddy (web server) |
| Portable Java | api.adoptium.net (Eclipse Temurin) |
| Manuals (PDF) | archive.org |
| WHO childbirth references (PDF) | iris.who.int (WHO); citations and noncommercial redistribution terms in the [medical guide](docs/Medical-READ-ME-FIRST.md) |
| Phone apps (APK) | github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android, f-droid.org |
| Education (optional) | download.kiwix.org (Khan Academy ZIM), github.com/learningequality/kolibri (Kolibri app) |
| Extra archives (optional) | download.kiwix.org (Wikivoyage, Wikibooks ZIM) |
| Health topics (optional) | medlineplus.gov/xml.html (MedlinePlus health topic XML, US National Library of Medicine; public domain) |

**Verify the installer before running it.** Each script's SHA-256 is published in
[`SHA256SUMS.txt`](SHA256SUMS.txt) and CI checks they stay in sync.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/main/get-offline-library.sh
sha256sum get-offline-library.sh      # compare against SHA256SUMS.txt
bash get-offline-library.sh
```
```powershell
# Windows
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elhajahmadj/offline-emergency-library/main/Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -OutFile Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1
Get-FileHash Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Algorithm SHA256   # compare against SHA256SUMS.txt
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1
```

The scripts are plain Bash/PowerShell — you're encouraged to read them first. (Hashes match
the files served by GitHub `raw` and the release assets; a `git clone` on Windows rewrites
line endings, so local hashes will differ there.)

---

## 🗺️ Choosing your map region (optional — default is US)

The maps default to the **United States**. To download a different country, region, or
continent, add `-Region` (Windows) / `--region` (macOS/Linux):

```bash
# Windows
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "E:\" -Region France
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "E:\" -Region "Germany,Austria"
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "E:\" -Region Europe      # whole continent
# macOS / Linux
./get-offline-library.sh -d /mnt/usb --region Japan
./get-offline-library.sh -d /mnt/usb --region US_texas          # a sub-region
./get-offline-library.sh -d /mnt/usb --region world             # everything (hundreds of GB!)
```

**Not sure of the name? List what's available (no download):**
```bash
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -ListRegions              # Windows: all countries/regions
./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -ListRegions -Filter US   # Windows: sub-regions of the US
./get-offline-library.sh --list-regions            # macOS/Linux: all
./get-offline-library.sh --list-regions France     # macOS/Linux: sub-regions of France
```

Accepts a country (`France`), several (`"Germany,Austria"`), a continent (`Europe`,
`Africa`, `Asia`, `North-America`, `South-America`, `Central-America`,
`Australia-Oceania`), a sub-region (`US_texas`, `Germany_bayern`), or `world`.
**Common names and ISO codes also work** (`UK`, `USA`, `GBR`, `DEU`, `JPN`, `UAE`,
`Holland`, `Czech`, …) — they're translated to the right OsmAnd name automatically.
**Size varies:** US ≈17 GB, a small country <1 GB, a continent tens of GB, `world`
hundreds of GB — the installer prints the size and warns before large downloads.

## 🧭 After it finishes

The installer writes a **`README.html`** at the root of the download folder — a full,
clickable **index of every guide, document, manual, archive, app and data file** on the
drive (auto-generated by scanning the folders). Open that first for a complete map of
everything, or **`START-HERE.html`** for a guided intro.

(You can regenerate the index any time with `build-readme-index.ps1 -Root "<folder>"`.)

Both pages link to each component's guide:

- `I-NEED-TO.html` — **emergency quick index**: "I need to…" → straight to the right file
- `EMERGENCY-ESSENTIALS.html` — **printable one-pager**: critical reminders (bleeding, CPR,
  water, signalling, frequencies) for when the battery is dead — print it while you have power
- `AI-Offline\HOW-TO-RUN-OFFLINE-AI.html` — run the offline AI chat
- `AI-Offline\DocReader-GPT4All\HOW-TO-ASK-YOUR-DOCS.html` — ask AI about your PDFs
- `Kiwix-Reader\HOW-TO-USE-KIWIX.html` — read the `.zim` archives
- `OsmAnd\HOW-TO-VIEW-MAPS.html` — view maps on a PC (no phone) or phone
- `OsmAnd\MAP-AND-COMPASS.html` - [map and compass guide](docs/MAP-AND-COMPASS.md)
  ([offline HTML](docs/MAP-AND-COMPASS.html)): print for navigation without a device
- `Maps-Browser\OPEN-MAPS.bat` / `OPEN-MAPS.sh` — street maps in a web browser (opt-in)
- `Phone-Apps\USE-ON-PHONE.html` — port the library to a phone
- `Manuals\READ-ME-FIRST.html` and `Medical\READ-ME-FIRST.html`
- `Medical\PSYCHOLOGICAL-FIRST-AID.html` — helping people (and yourself) cope with panic,
  fear, grief and stress in a crisis
- `Manuals\Radio-Communications\RADIO-GUIDE.html` — emergency radio comms
- `Manuals\Radio-Communications\RADIO-FREQUENCIES.html` - printable US frequency tables,
  regional cautions and primary sources (NOAA, FCC, USCG, FAA)
- `Education\READ-ME-FIRST.html` — Khan Academy offline (opt-in)
- `Education\HOW-TO-KOLIBRI.html` — Kolibri learning app, pick subjects/low-res (opt-in)

## 🧪 Keep it safe: two copies + CHECK-DRIVE

A single drive is a single point of failure: it can be lost, dropped, or slowly corrupted
(bit rot). Do these three things:

1. **Keep two copies.** Copy the whole `OfflineLibrary` folder to a second drive, and store
   that drive in a different place.
2. **Check both drives every few months.** At the end of every install, the installer writes
   **`CHECKSUMS-SHA256.txt`**: one SHA-256 fingerprint for every file on the drive. It also
   puts **CHECK-DRIVE** next to it, which re-reads every file and prints only the problems.
   It ends with `RESULT: ALL <n> FILES OK.` or a list of damaged or missing files.
3. **Fix a damaged file** by copying it from the other drive. Or delete it and re-run the
   installer, which downloads anything that is missing (it does not re-check files that are
   already there).

**Run CHECK-DRIVE before you re-run the installer.** Each run writes a new list from the files
as they are at that moment, so a file that was already damaged would be listed as good.

| OS | Double-click | Or in a terminal, inside the `OfflineLibrary` folder |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `CHECK-DRIVE.bat` | `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File check-drive.ps1` |
| macOS | `CHECK-DRIVE.command` | `shasum -a 256 -c -q CHECKSUMS-SHA256.txt` |
| Linux | — | `sha256sum -c --quiet CHECKSUMS-SHA256.txt` |

The list uses relative paths (`./Medical/...`), so it works on a copy too: run CHECK-DRIVE on
the second drive the same way. On a large drive a full check reads every byte, so it takes a
while (roughly the time it takes to copy the drive).

**exFAT** is the best format for a drive used on Windows, macOS and Linux, but it has no
journal: pulling the drive out during a write can damage files. Always **eject** it first.
macOS also writes small `._*` files on exFAT drives; CHECK-DRIVE ignores them.

> `CHECKSUMS-SHA256.txt` on the drive covers the **library**. The repo's
> [`SHA256SUMS.txt`](SHA256SUMS.txt) covers only the **installer scripts** (see
> Trust & verification above).

## Advanced: options and flags

Add these to the commands in [E) Clone and run](#e-clone-and-run) (see the [Quick start](#quick-start-with-a-smaller-download) examples). The one-liners in C and D cannot take flags as written.
None of them are needed for a normal install.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-Lite` / `--lite` | Quick start: 3B AI + medical/survival references + regional maps; omit Wikipedia, larger models, GPT4All, iFixit and Appropedia (see size note above) |
| `-Region <name>` / `--region <name>` | Choose map region (default `US`); country, continent, sub-region, or `world` |
| `-ListRegions` / `--list-regions [filter]` | List available map regions, then exit (no download) |
| `-Education` / `--education` | **Add Khan Academy** archive (Kiwix ZIM, ~168 GB with videos) — off by default |
| `-EduLang <en\|es\|fr>` / `--edu-lang <…>` | Khan Academy language (default `en`) |
| `-BrowserMaps` / `--browser-maps` | **Add street maps for any web browser** (US states, ~16.5 GB for all, on top of ~17.8 GB of OsmAnd maps, so ~34 GB of maps in total; follows `-Region`) — off by default |
| `-Kolibri` / `--kolibri` | **Add the Kolibri learning app** (pick subjects + low-res in-app; tens of GB) — off by default |
| `-ExtraZims` / `--extra-zims` | **Add Wikivoyage + Wikibooks** (Kiwix ZIM, ~5.8 GB; CC BY-SA) into `Extra-Archives\` — off by default. WikiHow is not on download.kiwix.org today, so it is not included |
| `-Translate` / `--translate` | **Add an offline translator** (Qwen3 4B model, ~2.5 GB; Apache 2.0) with `TRANSLATE.bat` / `translate.sh` in `AI-Offline\` - off by default. Uses the bundled AI engine, so nothing else is installed. See [HOW-TO-TRANSLATE](docs/HOW-TO-TRANSLATE.md) for which languages work |
| `-MedlinePlus` / `--medlineplus` | **Add MedlinePlus health topics** (~30 MB; public domain) as one offline page, `Medical\MedlinePlus\MedlinePlus-Health-Topics.html` - off by default. Summaries only: the copyrighted encyclopedia and drug pages are not included |
| `-SkipWikipedia` / `--skip-wikipedia` | Don't download the 24 GB Wikipedia dump (~24 GB saved) |
| `-SkipMaps` / `--skip-maps` | Don't download the maps (~17 GB saved for US) |
| `-SkipModels` / `--skip-models` | Skip the large 8B/7B AI models, keep the small 3B (~9 GB saved) |
| `-Only <piece>[,<piece>]` / `--only <piece>[,<piece>]` | **Add just these pieces to a drive you already made** (see below). Pieces: `translate`, `medlineplus`, `extra-zims`, `browser-maps`, `education`, `kolibri`, `wikipedia`. Cannot be combined with `-Lite`, the `-Skip` options or the piece switches above |
| `-NoAria` / `--no-aria` | Force `curl` even if `aria2c` is installed |

Example: `./Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "F:\" -SkipWikipedia -SkipMaps`

### Add one piece to a finished drive

To add something later without re-running the whole install, point the installer at the same
destination with `-Only` (Windows) or `--only` (macOS/Linux):

```
.\Get-OfflineLibrary.ps1 -Destination "F:\" -Only translate
./get-offline-library.sh -d /mnt/usb --only translate,medlineplus
```

It downloads only those pieces, then rebuilds `README.html`, `CHECKSUMS-SHA256.txt` (a full
read of the drive, so it takes a while on a big drive) and runs the self-check. It stops with a
plain message, before downloading anything, if the folder is not a finished library or a piece
needs something the drive lacks: `translate` needs the AI engine. Nothing is installed for you
in that case. `browser-maps` follows `-Region` / `--region` and `education` follows
`-EduLang` / `--edu-lang`, as in a full install.
