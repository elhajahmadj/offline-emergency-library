"""Build the phone docs pack (#79): a small zip for on-device document-AI apps.

Contents:
  - every manual PDF in doc-qa/sources.tsv (the text-checked set the manual reader uses),
    fetched from the same source the installers use and checked against its recorded hash;
  - the phone-useful guides in GUIDES, as Markdown (document-AI apps import .md);
  - README.txt and LICENSES.txt (per-file attribution from sources.tsv).

Usage:
  build-phone-pack.py OUT.zip               download the PDFs
  build-phone-pack.py OUT.zip --from DRIVE  copy them from an installed drive instead

README = f"""Offline Emergency Library - phone docs pack
=============================================

Survival, first-aid, medical, repair and food-growing manuals (PDF) plus short
emergency guides (Markdown), sized for a phone.

Use it:
  - Unzip it (Files app on iPhone/iPad; any file manager on Android).
  - Open the PDFs in any PDF reader, or import the PDFs and .md guides into an
    on-device document-AI app (for example NomadAI) and ask questions offline.

Medical books are references, not a substitute for a clinician.
